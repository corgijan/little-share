# Small Backup (Smackup)
Smackup is a small Backup solution that supports just files. Via the ENV you can set replicated folders (I use it to replicate to multiple HDDs/SSDs). All files between all folders are synced. Also it has an eassy web frontend.


```shell
alias rust-musl-builder='docker run --rm -it -v "$(pwd)":/home/rust/src messense/rust-musl-cross:armv7-musleabihf'                                                 î‚² I
